   <p>Sankranti is a harvest festival celebrated in India. Sankranti is derived from the word 'Sankramana', meaning a 'change'. It is also called 'Makara Sankranti', as the Sun enters 'Makara Rasi' that day. It usually falls on 14th of January every year. The Sun starts its northward journey from the Tropic of Capricorn towards the Tropic of Cancer. This journey is called 'Uttarayana', meaning northward march. We, in India, are to the north of the equator. W rejoice on Sankranti Day, because the chilly cold winter comes to a close, and healthy sunny days are about to begin.
    Sankranti is called 'Pongal' in Tamilnadu and 'Pedda' or 'Peddala' Panduga in some parts of Andhra Pradesh. 'Pedda' means big and 'Panduga' means a festival. It is a festival, when prayers and offerings are made to ancestors. It is celebrated in different ways in different parts of the country, as it is a harvest festival. It is a festival to thank God for giving a good harvest. By January the paddy, the pulses, the sugarcane and all other cereals would have been harvested. The farmers would be full of joy and happiness.The first day of Makar Sankranti festival in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is called Bhoghi. It’s a day to discard old clothes and items and concentrate on new beginnings. A bonfire with logs of wood, other solid fuels and waste wooden furniture is lit at dawn to get the day started. Along with the disposal of these derelict things, it is believed that old habits, vices, attachment to relations and material things</p>
    <h2 color="green">The term Hinduism</h2>
    <p>The term Hinduism became familiar as a designator of religious ideas and practices distinctive to India with the publication of books such as Hinduism (1877) by Sir Monier Monier-Williams, the notable Oxford scholar and author of an influential Sanskrit dictionary. Initially it was an outsiders’ term, building on centuries-old usages of the word Hindu. Early travelers to the Indus valley, beginning with the Greeks and Persians, spoke of its inhabitants as “Hindu” (Greek: ‘indoi), and, in the 16th century, residents of India themselves began very slowly to employ the term to distinguish themselves from the Turks. Gradually the distinction became primarily religious rather than ethnic, geographic, or cultural.</p>
