   <p>But in some parts of India, communities begin the festivities by lighting bonfires the night before in a celebration known as Holika Dahan, or Choti Holi.

    The bonfires are a nod to one of the most well-known legends associated with the festival – a story about the triumph of good over evil.
    
    The story goes something like this: The demon king Hiranyakashayap, who wanted to be worshipped as a god, became angry that his son Prahlad was instead a devotee of the deity Vishnu, the preserver and protector of the universe. In turn, Hiranyakashayap conspired with his sister Holika to kill his son.

<p>Taking a dip in rivers or ponds is an important practice for Hindus on Makar Sankranti. The Ganges River is considered an especially auspicious place to bathe on this holiday, particularly at Gangasagar—where the Ganges (Ganga) River system meets the sea (sagar) at the Bay of Bengal—on Sagar Island in West Bengal. Another important site for pilgrims to take a ritual bath on Makar Sankranti is in Prayagraj, where the Ganges meets the Yamuna River and the mythical Saraswati River, as part of the annual Magh Mela festival. Makar Sankranti at Prayagraj also inaugurates the ritual bathing for the Kumbh Mela festival, which takes place at that location every 12 years and in 2019 attracted more than 200 million pilgrims over the span of several weeks.</p>
